        "Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) are a class of convolutional networks (CNNs) \n",
        "aimed to incorporate unsupervised learning. Some key components of the DCGAN architecture are the use of the Tanh activation function for the generator's output layer, LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator, and the removal of any fully connected hidden layers. With these features, the original study conducted was able to create a robust DCGAN, achieving an 82.8% accuracy on the on the CIFAR-10 image dataset."

        "The graphs above help visualize the performances of the various GAN models with both oracle and real training. Each of our 3 models seemed to perform much better than TextGan in the NLL-Test with both Oracle and real training, as well as under the Embedding Similarity metric with Oracle training. Another interesting note is that CGan's performance seems to improve quite a bit under adversarial training under the Embedding Similarity Metric with real training, while InfoGan and TextGan seems to perform worse in the same measure. Similarly, as the number of epochs increases, CGan's performances eclipses those of the other 4 models under the NLL measure with Oracle training. Of course, these metrics are only measured across 5 epochs, so it'd be helpful to see how the models perform given more time. But we can still use this information to get a better understanding of each model's performance."

        "Given the short duration of setup, running, etc there was not sufficient time to truly understand each of the models under the project. Two models from the previous milestone were used as the benchmark for comparison with the three newly incorporated models added with this milestone. However more time would be require for all encompassing tasking to really dive in and understand these models, and to run over longer epochs to see more concrete data results and comparisons. Additionally it should be noted the amount of time it takes to run these models with higher epoch values. Running the full models over and over can help training, however can take hours to complete. Furthermore, the .csv files were not populating. Given more time dedicate to this project, issues may have been able to be resolved"
