Stephanie:
	   		1. Updated notebook to be more structured and include the baseline models under test to compare new metrics added
	   		2. Added first metric: 
				Time Elapse Interval (TEI) : Measures time elapse for the model per interval (epoch) run. Used to measure average time efficiency to run model for each training during epochs. 
							     Helps gauge run time during various model training components (ie pre training and adversarial training)
Jackson:
			1. Added Metric 2
Ravjot:
			1. Added Metric 3
