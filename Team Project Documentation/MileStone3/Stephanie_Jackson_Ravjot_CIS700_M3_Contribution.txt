Stephanie:
	   		1. Updated notebook to be more structured and include the baseline models under test to compare new metrics added
			2. Updated main.py and utils/visual.py, visual.py directory order now sorted, additioanlly setting subplots columns to two and rows to calc
			3. Assist other members with their metrics
	   		4. Added first metric: 
				Time Elapse Interval (TEI) : Measures time elapse for the model per interval (epoch) run. Used to measure average time efficiency to run model for each training during epochs. 
							     Helps gauge run time during various model training components (ie pre training and adversarial training)
			5. Assisting team with implementation of their responsible metrics
Jackson:
			1. Added Metric 2
Ravjot:
			1. Added Metric 3
